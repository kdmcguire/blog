Every Monday lunchtime, my partner and I walk into town to get a couple of vegan sausage rolls from our friendly local baked-goods supergiant. (You know the one.)

Sausage rolls in hand, we stroll back to Butchery Lane and stop on the corner.

_Let it now be known as Sausage Roll Corner._

From there, we have a perfect view. A cobbled street, wonky old buildings, and the beautiful cathedral, intricate and solid, behind Burgate.

Every time, it makes me think that a similar scenario might've played out centuries ago. People running errands, eating food, looking at the cathedral and asking "How???" to their friends. Other people, like us, people-watching.

Maybe they wouldn't have got vegan sausage rolls, though.
