Last week, in a conversation about how toxic Twitter/X has become, I spoke a quick aside to a colleague.

> We don’t have to talk about it right now, but I would like to suggest you consider deleting your X account. Elon Musk is awful and staying there helps him.

To my surprise, she said *“you’re right,”* and deleted her account *then and there*.

Obviously the question had been on her mind already, and I am lucky to be able to expect thoughtful, kind behaviour from my teammates especially, but it was still a nice reminder that occasionally people do listen and make changes based on ideals. It was refreshing!

After that, I suggested Mastodon. It’s not necessarily as good for local news, but it has successfully replaced Twitter/X and Instagram for me so I’d like to share a few recommendations. I won’t rehash the most generic starter info that already exists (in better quality) elsewhere, just my highlights.

1. **Choose a server.** This is where your profile lives, and is the base for your experience. You want one that is actively supported and moderated, has principles (and rules) you agree with, and ideally a shared interest/community. I chose [Hachyderm.io](https://www.hachyderm.io) because it’s for people interested and working in tech, and aspires to be a safe space for everyone.
2. **Follow some hashtags for instant content.** I like [#BirdsOfMastodon](https://hachyderm.io/tags/birdsofmastodon), [#BloomScrolling](https://hachyderm.io/tags/bloomscrolling), [#CatsOfMastodon](https://hachyderm.io/tags/catsofmastodon), [#Caturday](https://hachyderm.io/tags/caturday), [#DogsOfMastodon](https://hachyderm.io/tags/dogsofmastodon), [#FatFrogFriday](https://hachyderm.io/tags/fatfrogfriday), [#FensterFreitag](https://hachyderm.io/tags/fensterfreitag), [#LichenSubscribe](https://hachyderm.io/tags/lichensubscribe), [#Mosstodon](https://hachyderm.io/tags/Mosstodon), [#SilentSunday](https://hachyderm.io/tags/silentsunday) … and more!
3. **Follow some people.** There’s no algorithm, so you do have to do this a bit more manually to get the ball rolling. Follow [me](https://hachyderm.io/@kieranmcguire), look through the [people I’m following](https://hachyderm.io/@kieranmcguire/following) and follow some of them, use [Followgraph for Mastodon](https://followgraph.vercel.app/) to find people followed by multiple people you’re already following (only uses public data), and use the [StreetPass](https://streetpass.social/) extension to keep track of any Mastodon accounts associated with sites you visit.
4. **Follow some more people!** (I follow 687 people at the time of writing this.) People you follow will boost posts from people you don't follow yet; if you like it, follow them too. There's no algorithm here to bring 'trending' content into your feed, so follow lots of people and your feed will feel alive.
