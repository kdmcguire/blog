I hope to come back to this and add more thoughts, images, maybe even links to proper reviews, but for now I just want to get the list down.

These are all things that were new to me in 2024, not necessarily published or released in that year.

- **Book:** Three-Body Problem
- **Album:** Butterfly 3000 by KGLW
- **Song:** Blue Morpho, from the above
- **Game:** Stalker 2
- **Film:** The Manchurian Candidate (2004)
