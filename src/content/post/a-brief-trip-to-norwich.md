At the end of September, my partner and I enjoyed a trip to Norwich for a few days. As we were characteristically late to decide where we wanted to go and book everything, I'd say we were lucky that it went so well.

We're both food-loving vegans, so our holidays are usually city breaks in places that look like they have plentiful vegan options. And Norwich did not disappoint! To be honest, we probably should have expected great things from Norwich; a medieval market town, now university city? _Of course_ it's got some bustle!

We were only there for three nights, but we had such a lovely time that I'm sure we'll go back before too long.

Here are my highlights, in no particular order.

## The Tipsy Vegan

We went to The Tipsy Vegan twice! It was fantastic and they had so many options that we wanted to try. The first visit was for a selection of tapas-style smaller plates, and the second was for 'mains'. My main was the Nashville Hot Burger, which was both not like most burgers I've had recently and very, very tasty.

## Slice & Dice

We also went to Slice & Dice twice, the first and last morning, for the vegan Big Breakfast (pictured at the top). It was huge, delicious, and had both hash browns and fried potato... cubes? I don't know what you'd call them but they were most welcome.

## Strangers Coffee

I love coffee. Fortunately for me, my partner finds my obsession more endearing and entertaining than annoying. Whenever we go somewhere new she will look for at least one coffee shop to take me to, ideally a few so she can ask me to rank them. I think there was a ranking for the Norwich coffee shops but I can't remember it now, so I'll just say that **Strangers Coffee** are the winners of my personal tournament, hands down!

We went to two Strangers Coffee locations, the cafe on Pottergate street and the roastery with a serving window on Dove Street. Both are excellent but the roastery on Dove Street gave me an _incredible_ espresso, so they just squeak past the cafe to win the title of **Best of the Best**.

## Sir Toby's Beers

This tiny, impressively stocked bar is in the market, on the edge alongside Gaol Hill. My partner likes browsing charity shops and haberdasheries more than I do, so rather than follow her around and make her feel like she has to hurry, I like to go somewhere where I can sit with a coffee or a beer and read, people-watch, listen to the hubbub. For that, Sir Toby's Beers served me well! The staff were friendly and the beers varied and refreshing.

## Tofurei

We couldn't fit in a proper visit to Tofurei (next time!) but we did manage to get some cake for the train home, and we were so, so glad we did! It was delicious! I had the "chocolate-dipped flapjack" and, compared to the other flapjacks I've had on past train journeys in my life, it was like meeting a higher being.

Go there. Eat cake.

## Norwich Cathedral

Obviously, you can't go to a medieval cathedral city without seeing the titular cathedral. It was, as you'd expect, beautiful and awe-inspiring. I can't deny it, though... my favourite moment was spotting the cathedral cat, who immediately came to me for some scritches. Very good.
