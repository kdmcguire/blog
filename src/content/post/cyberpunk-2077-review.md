This game suffers from sub-par open-world AI (i.e. crowds and traffic), performance issues, and many, many bugs. The bugs I experienced were mostly minor, like things colliding badly, or multiple conversations running at the same time, but I did once have a quest become un-finishable until I went back and did something different. Other people have obviously experienced worse. BUT.

If you can get past that, there is a brilliant, evocative, thrilling, disturbing, raucous, emotional story here, with compelling characters on one hell of a journey. I did not expect to feel so sad at finishing this game, and I got a happy ending, but I know I'll never 'finish' it for the first time again.

Jackie. Johnny. Night City. So long, choombas.
