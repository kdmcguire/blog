This is a public service announcement.

Go [download the Atkinson Hyperlegible font](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) and install it.

Why? Because I think it deserves to be used more, and I would love for more sites to be able to use it without sites having to provide individual copies of it and for their visitors' browsers to download it over and over again. When I briefly made this site provide a copy of the font itself, I immediately saw the carbon cost increase. (From 0.03g of CO2 to 0.04g, which is not exactly statistically significant, but still!)

I won't expound its benefits here, the Braille Institute does that in the page I linked to earlier. Even if you think you have perfect vision, you may find it easier to read than normal serif or sans-serif fonts.

I recommend setting it to your browsers default sans-serif font (if you can) so that sites that defer to your default (e.g. Wikipedia) will use it too.

The best font is a local font!
