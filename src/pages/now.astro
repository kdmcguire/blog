		<p class="mb-4">
			In 2021, I moved from a tiny village in Essex to the bustling (but still relatively compact)
			city of Canterbury in Kent! I am enjoying feeling like a 'local' here, even if it's only been
			a couple of years.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			<em>To do: write a blog post for my local recommendations!</em>
		</p>
		<h2 class="title mb-4 text-xl">Work</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			I work as a Digital Platform Manager for British Red Cross. I'm part of a new internal team
			trying to build a new 'Web Platform'. We think the better tech and ways-of-working will be a
			boon in the long run. I've <a

			>.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title mb-4 text-xl">Reading</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			I usually have three categories of book on the go at once: fiction, non-fiction, and a
			comic/graphic novel. I didn't read much for a few years and am trying to cultivate the habit
			again, so I find having a few different things to swap between helps keep me from getting
			stuck in a rut.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			I've become a bit frustrated with BookWyrm, it's pretty unstable and has a huge problem with
			duplicate books and even authors. For now, I'm trying out <a
				href="https://hardcover.app/"
				class="cactus-link">Hardcover.app</a
			>. The founders/devs are looking into the ability to import books and reading history from a
			BookWyrm export.
